<li>The Canadian Health Clock is a digital clock with two categories: Deaths so far today (as of 12:00 midnight) and Deaths so far this year (as of January 1).</li>
<li>It has a main clock that shows the total number of deaths from all causes, and numerous sub-clocks that shows deaths from the top 10 causes of death and all other cause.</li>
<li>The blinking red dot shows that all clocks are working.</li>
<li>It has an analogue version (that features a moving circle) and a digital version (table format)</li>
<li>The moving circle for each analogue clock indicates one death when a circle is complete. The same moving circle applies to deaths so far today and this year.</li>
