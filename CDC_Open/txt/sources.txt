The number of deaths for 'Dementia including Alzheimer's disease' was obtained by the Public Health Agency of Canada from custom tabulation from Statistics Canada. It is necessary to add dementia to Alzheimer's disease as Statistics Canada uses a list developped by the US National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) for ranking. Since dementia is not in the US list, it did not make it into Stat Can's top 10 or even top 50 causes of death, even with 18,649 deaths, while Alzheimer's Disease [ICD-10 G30], in the US list, ranks number 7 with 6521 deaths in 2016. Together dementia including Alzheimer's ranks number 3.
